Salvaging – Simple Tracker for Sailing

This plugin helps you keep track of what’s going on while you’re out salvaging at sea.
It gives you a small, easy-to-read overlay that shows:

What the plugin shows

Your cargo amount
After you’ve opened your cargo once, the plugin remembers it and keeps it updated as you collect more salvage.

How much your crew is salvaging
It counts how many hooks each crew member lands, and keeps track of the total for the whole crew.

If you are salvaging or cleaning
It can tell when you start or stop working on a wreck, or when you’re brushing debris off your hook.

What it’s for

The idea is to give you a quick overview of:

How active the crew is

How full your cargo is getting

Whether you are currently doing something or just waiting around

Everything is shown in a simple, lightweight overlay so you can glance at it while sailing.

How to use it

Just hop on a boat and start salvaging.
Open your cargo once so the plugin knows your storage size.
After that, it updates automatically as you continue your run.
